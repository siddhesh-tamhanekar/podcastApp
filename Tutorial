Hello friends, today we are going to create full functional fluttr app which will 
excercise many of the flutter concepts.
so let's start with understanding what we are going to build

main feature of the app to enable user to listen their favorite podcast by simply providing rss url.
then app will also able to remember the url submitted by user so user doesn't need to everytime 
add submit the url to the app.


So where we could find the rss feeds for podcast 
here is website http://listennotes.com where you have to search topic and you will get trending topics there. 
and click on rss link  to get it.

This rss feeds contains title, pubDate, description, and episodes of the podcast.


This flutter tutorial is going to excercise following concepts
XML parsing in dart (as rss feeds are in dart)
XML feeds can be too large so parsing them into the seperate dart isolate will be good idea so background execution of the PodcastApp
adding media player into flutter app 
adding delightful animations 
Design whole app using Bloc pattern.


This tutorial will be available in series. and today is the first part of series.
